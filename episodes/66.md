  **Overview:**

  Although it seems like it was only yesterday that Vuex 4 came out, we have
  noticed that there is already an RFC out for Vuex 5, and it looks pretty
  exciting! It seems as though Vuex 4 was really just meant to replace Vuex 3 in
  Vue 3. Whereas we can safely say that there are some big changes on the
  horizon for Vuex 5, and we use today’s show to dive into them. Our discussion
  begins with a brief description of what exactly Vuex is and then after that,
  we dig into all the new features to expect from the update. We devote quite a
  big chunk of our conversation to sharing our perspectives on the composition
  API versus the Vuex store, and we talk about how one might replace the other
  as well as how to use them in conjunction with one another. We also get into
  the intention to start using actions rather than mutations to update state and
  what it means that the Vue team is deciding to get rid of modules.
  Furthermore, our discussion covers features such as composition-based stores,
  automatic store registration, SSR and hydration, plugins, TypeScript support,
  and more. Ultimately, the shifts in Vuex 5 herald a huge paradigm shift and we
  are excited to see how the Vue community reacts to it. Tune in to hear for the
  full scoop!


  **Key Points From This Episode:**
