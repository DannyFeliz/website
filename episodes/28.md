shownotes: "Welcome to Enjoy the Vue!  Today, we have special guest, Michael Thiessen, a developer at Vidyard.  He also writes a lot about Vue on his blog and creates courses and videos. We will find out how Michael got started with Vue and what his motivation was. We will discuss reusable components, what it means to have a clean versus a reusable component, gold plating, Dunning-Kruger effect, and when to use provide and inject.”  Chris gives a really useful tip on what he does when he refactors components.
