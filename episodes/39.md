  We often touch on the topic of conferences and today we are doing a bit of a
  deeper dive on the subject, looking at the application to speak at events and
  more! We start off this episode with some initial thoughts and early
  experiences that we have had, and the lessons that are quickly learned when
  you get into the public speaking game. We think about what motivates people to
  pursue the stressful and sometimes terrifying job of speaking to groups of
  people, last-minute preparations, and the impetus that presenting gives a
  process of learning. Throughout this chat there are a host of tips on offer,
  from avoiding Q & A sessions to accepting topics you do not already
  understand, so make sure to keep a notepad on hand to up your game! With
  conferences being such a great place to network, make connections and form
  important friendships, no matter how you engage with events, we highly
  recommend at least attending these kinds of gatherings â€“ you never know what
  might come of it! We finish off this exploration thinking about virtual
  events, conference call tech, and more, so make sure to listen in with us
  today on Enjoy the Vue!
