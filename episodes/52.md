shownotes: >-
  The way an app is experienced by its users is one of its most important
  features and as a UI/UX developer or designer, catering to this need is about
  more than just being good at coding. Today on the show our guest is Jenell
  Pizarro who joins us to talk about some of the main things she is concerned
  with as a UX developer. We kick off the show with a discussion about the many
  job titles within UI and UX, the difference between these two categories, and
  how a UX developer differs from a UX designer. From there, we get into some of
  the main challenges that teams within the UI/UX niche face when working with
  clients. Often clients find bugs in an app in its beta phases or have
  different qualms about its functionality, and as a UX developer, navigating
  these in a way that is best for everybody can be quite a sensitive journey. We
  then zoom in on the topic of accessibility, highlighting the ethical
  obligation developers have to make their apps usable by people in all
  situations, even though stakeholders might have a different and more
  profit-driven set of motives. For Jenell, developers should put their foot
  down, and not forget the importance of soft skills such as empathy, because UX
  is about making people happy, whatever their background or situation looks
  like. Accessibility is also an issue that holds relevance amongst developers
  even before the client comes into the equation, and there are ways of coding
  that help keep readability a top priority in teams. Toward the end of the
  show, we get into the weeds of coding in JavaScript, sharing some pet peeves
  about index variable naming in loops and other best practices. As always, we
  wrap up with some awesome picks of the week so for all this and more, tune in
  today!

  - “That's my goal in life is to ensure that people forget that they're
  actually even using the application, because it becomes such a normal part of
  their life, that it just becomes second nature.” — @nellarro [0:01:43]

  - “It's a human right to be able to use the Internet. I feel as developers, we
  need to make sure that all humans can use the web, period.” — @nellarro

  - “I think that's really important is making sure that your code is readable
  for an engineer to be able to look at your code and be like, ‘I get that. I
  see what's happening.’” — @nellarro [0:33:19]
