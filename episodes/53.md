  ## Overview

  Watch and watchEffect have very particular purposes in Vue.js. Despite their
  subtle evolution between Vue 2 and Vue 3, both share valuable uses in
  composition API. Today we speak with special guest Alex Riviere to talk about
  watch and watchEffect, their respective nuances, and why, although useful,
  they may not be the answer to your problems. We start off by hearing about the
  uses of watchers in Vue 2 before unpacking watchEffect in more detail. A theme
  throughout the episode, Alex shares a range of caveats to watch and
  watchEffect, touching on JavaScript, cached values, and contrasts between
  value to functions and reference to functions. After recapping the main
  differences between watch and watchEffect, Alex defines what side effects you
  can face before explaining what he feels is helpful about current docs on
  watch and watchEffect. Toward the end of the show, Alex boils watch and
  watchEffect down to a very simple metaphor, and to conclude, we go through
  this week’s top picks. Join us to find out about the best in Vue!

  ## Tweetables:

  - “In Vue 3 we have watch and watchEffect in the composition API.” — @fimion

  - “With the composition API, you can now import from Vue watch or watchEffect.
  WatchEffect allows you to define a function that accesses some reactive
  value.” — @fimion [0:03:43]

  - “So when we're passing complex objects to the watch function, it doesn't
  immediately want to be able to show you the old version and the new version.
  We kind of got to do some stuff to it.” — @fimion [0:08:45]

  - “Sometimes watch is not the correct answer. It's a very powerful tool. It
  can do a lot of really good and cool things. May not always be the correct
  answer, however.” — @fimion [0:23:04]
