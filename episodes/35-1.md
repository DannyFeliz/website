  ## Summary


  Today we explore the topic of hybrid app development for the first time on the
  show, and joining us to help unpack the issue at hand is our friend Mike
  Hartington! Mike is a developer at Ionic and he shares his experiences from
  his work there as well as on the Cordova and Capacitor projects. We run
  through the important parts of these different routes to app building and Mike
  does a great job of explaining how these worlds fit together and how they do
  not! The conversation also covers app deployment, common mistakes, and what it
  takes to get started on Capacitor. Mike makes a great argument for why not
  every possibility should be entertained and how unnecessary elements to apps
  can lead to the downfall of your software. We also discuss debugging and
  accessibility before finishing off our chat talking about forums, help, and
  the one thing that Mike would change about Capacitor if he could go back.
