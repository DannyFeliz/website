  Welcome back to another episode of Enjoy the Vue. This concludes our
  three-part interview with Babel maintainer, Henry Zhu. Last time, we closed
  our discussion with what work maintainers of open source projects do that is
  not straight coding. In this episode, we continue talking with Henry about
  what do people count as maintenance work versus other tasks that definitely
  need to get done, but are perhaps less visible to the public eye. Henry also
  shares his approaches to taking care of himself and the pursuit of
  serendipity, and we discuss the inclusivity of the open source community, the
  relationship between in-person communities and open source culture, and we get
  into our picks of the week, so make sure not to miss this episode!


  **Key Points From This Episode:**

  - Henry opens with the dichotomy between freedom and obligation for
  maintainers.

  - Maintainers don’t see certain tasks as maintenance, such as answering user
  queries.

  - What Henry does to take care of himself, like sport or playing music, and
  his musings on what serendipity looks like in an online setting.

  - Spaces that promote serendipity, and why actively pursuing serendipity is
  not a paradox.

  - There are communities like Google Summer of Code that promote open source
  involvement.

  - Preferences are shaped through experiences of the communities, so it is
  important that they be inclusive, particularly for women.

  - The relationship between in-person communities and open source culture.

  - Ben’s picks this week include a ukulele, Azul, and Nadia Eghbal’s book,
  Working in Public.

  - Vikash recommends Kim’s Convenience and Race After Technology by Ruha
  Benjamin.

  - Henry’s picks include Tools for Conviviality by Ivan Illich, and a card game
  called The Mind.

  - Tessa suggests Journey, the Reply series, and Conquer Your Critical Inner
  Voice.


  **Tweetables:**

  - “How do we get people to have a higher sense of ownership so that we can
  lessen the burden on maintainers?” — @left_pad [0:02:37]


  - “There's an aspect of serendipity involves risk, and involves trust and
  faith in something, in the future. Me putting myself out there is going to
  lead to something good.” — @left_pad [0:05:50]


  - “I feel being more intentional, specifically reaching out to people, or
  getting involved in certain communities is probably better. There are formal
  versions of this, like Google Summer of Code. We've done that and Rails Girls,
  Summer of Code, stuff like that. Yeah, maybe we need more of that, instead of
  this blanket like, ‘Hey, anyone can get involved.’” — @left_pad [0:07:48]


  - “For a tool, we want self-expression from the people that use it and I think
  coding is – or anything, [Illich] mentions education, and school, and
  medicine, and coding could be another thing where it's increasingly harder to
  learn how to code, even though now we have boot camps and stuff.” — @left_pad
