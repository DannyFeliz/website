  **Overview**


  Some exciting changes have been happening with Vite 2, and here to walk us
  through them is Evan You, creator of Vue.js. In this jam-packed episode, Evan
  talks about the decision to make Vite 2 a framework-agnostic build tool. We
  hear about what went into this, and Evan unpacks some of the features that
  come with this development. Evan talks about the enjoyment he gets from
  working on something new and the freedom that comes with getting to work in
  unchartered territory. He sheds light on what it is like building a solution
  like this at scale and the fact that it is never going to be a linear process,
  but rather an iterative one. As a former design student, Evan is comfortable
  working this way because he knows how to work from the top down, refining as
  he goes. We also dive into VitePress and VuePress and what the relationship
  between the two will be, Vite's pre-bundling changes and the complexities
  involved there, and the drawbacks of multitasking. As usual, we wrap up the
  show with our weekly picks, so stay tuned right till the end to hear what
  everyone is most excited by this week!
