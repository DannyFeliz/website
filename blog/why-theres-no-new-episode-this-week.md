To support the United States protests against systemic racism and police brutality, we will be donating our sponsorship profits from last week's episode to [Campaign Zero](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/) and will not be releasing a new episode this week to avoid detracting from the global conversation on these grave injustices.

If you would also like to lend your support, here are a couple ways you can do so.

1. Donate

- [Campaign Zero](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/)
- [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/)
- [Minnesota Freedom Fund](https://minnesotafreedomfund.org/)
- [Black Visions Collective](https://secure.everyaction.com/4omQDAR0oUiUagTu0EG-Ig2)
- [Reclaim the Block](https://secure.everyaction.com/zae4prEeKESHBy0MKXTIcQ2)

2. Read about it

- [How To Be Antiracist, Ibram X Kendi](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-be-an-antiracist/9780525509288)
- [So You Want To Talk About Race, Ijeoma Oluo](https://bookshop.org/books/so-you-want-to-talk-about-race/9781580058827)

Thanks for your understanding. We hope you all stay safe amidst these trying times.
